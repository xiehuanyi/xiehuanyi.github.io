**Principal Investigator** (Nov 2022 - Jan 2023)

Researched domain adaptation techniques for Transformer-based machine translation models.
- **Implementation**: Implemented a transformer model and conducted experiments on three datasets: Oral (186,970 samples), Patent (100,000 samples), and Medical (100,000 samples).
- **Results**: Tested the feasibility of machine translation knowledge transfer. Results showed that applying the pretrained model to patent content improved performance by 37%, and further fine-tuning on the patent dataset led to an additional 30% enhancement in translation quality.
