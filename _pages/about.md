I am an MS/PhD student at **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)** in Saudi Arabia. Before joining KAUST, I was a Master's student in Data Science at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** and received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from **Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai** in 2024.

My research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), including instruction tuning, efficient fine-tuning, and evaluating data influence.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email.
