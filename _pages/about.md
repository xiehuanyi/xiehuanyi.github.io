I am a Master's student in Data Science at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (Stockholm, Sweden). I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the Department of Computer Science at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai** in 2024 (GPA: 87.37/100).

My research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), including instruction tuning, efficient fine-tuning, and evaluating data influence. I have research experience working on large-scale model development (Huozi) at HIT and video OCR systems at NTU.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email.
